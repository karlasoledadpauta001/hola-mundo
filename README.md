I was born in a beautiful city,near the Andes mountains, Cuenca, Ecuador.   I was born there, on September 17, 1990.  It was a lovely city to grow up in, specially becuase the weather was so perfect. It never got too cold or too hot.  I remember going to school everyday and afterschool, I would stop at the plaza to get some food with my friends.  Those days were easy.  I miss being a kid.
